        <h2>Definition of Preservation of Farm Produce</h2>
        <p>
          These are activities carried out after crops have been harvested from
          the farm. Preservation of farm produce also means to keep the harvest
          in good condition for future use.

              It prevents farm produce from getting spoilt too soon and so
              reduces the farmersâ€™ loss.

              Some preservation methods like canning can prolong the shelf life
              of farm produce for many months or even years.

              <h2>1. Sun Drying</h2>
              <p>
                This is one of the
                <a href="old.html" class="old">oldest</a> methods of
                preservation. It involves spreading out the farm produce in the
                sun to dry. It helps to get rid of most of the moisture in the
                produce. It allows for air
                <a href="circulate.html" class="old">circulation</a> and it
                helps all part of the farm produce to dry evenly.<br /><br />
                Examples of farm produce that can be preserved by sun-drying are
                tomatoes, pepper, cowpea, bitter leaf, melon, etc.

              <h2>2. Smoking</h2>
              <p>
                It involves the spreading of processed meat or fish over a fire
                to be dried by hot smoke and heat of the fire. Catfish, pork
                meat and other animal produce are preserved using this method.

            <div class="section-three-text">
              <h2>3. Salting</h2>
              <p>
                This is done by rubbing a good amount of salt on the food. Salt
                helps to prevent the growth of bacteria by drawing out most of
                moisture contained in the food that these bacteria need to
                survive. <br /><br />Examples of farm produce that can be
                preserved by salting are; meat, fish and green beans.

              <h2>4. Frying</h2>
              <p>
                In this method, food items are cooked in hot oil. Hot oil has a
                higher temperature than hot water. The heat kills most of the
                bacteria in food that causes spoilage. <br /><br />Examples of
                farm produce that can be preserved by frying are; meat, fish,
                plantain and potato.

              <h2>5. Refrigeration</h2>
              <p>
                Some farm produce can be preserved by keeping them cold in a
                refrigerator. <br /><br />Examples of farm produce that can be
                preserved by refrigeration are; Fresh fruits, dairy products and
                vegetables.

              <h2>6. Freezing</h2>
              <p>
                Some farm produce can be preserved for a long time by keeping
                them in a freezer. Keeping them in freezers ensures that the
                moisture in them turns into ice, thus stopping bacterial action
                completely. <br /><br />Examples of such produce that can be
                preserved are; meat and fish.

              <h2>7. Canning</h2>
              <p>
                Some farm produce is preserved by cooking and sealing them in
                germ-free cans or jars. The sealed cans or jars are then further
                boiled to kill any remaining bacteria. Sometimes, additional
                preservatives are added to the canned food to help preserve them
                for a longer period. Food preserved by canning or bottling can
                become spoilt if the can or bottle is left open for some time.
                <br /><br />Examples of farm produce that can be preserved by
                canning or bottling are; meat (corn beef), fish(sardine),
                tomatoes, peas, milk, vegetable oil and fruits, etc.

              <h2>8. Bottling</h2>
              <p>
                This method of preservation is commonly used for seeds and
                grains. The grains are kept in small sacks to prevent
                contamination and also to keep away pests that can destroy
                grains. <br /><br />Examples of farm produce that can be
                preserved by bagging are; rice, beans, wheat, millet and
                groundnut.
